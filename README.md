## 📚 About the Project

**ScheDulify** is an educational and interactive tool built to simulate different **CPU scheduling algorithms** in Operating Systems. Designed with clean visuals and user inputs, it helps understand how each scheduling algorithm behaves and how processes are prioritized and executed on the CPU.

---

## 💡 Features

- 🎯 Select and simulate different scheduling algorithms
- 📥 Add custom processes with burst time, arrival time, etc.
- 📊 Visualize Gantt charts for process execution
- 🔁 Algorithms supported: FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority Scheduling ,Priority preemptive ,Round Robin
- 🧪 Preemptive and Non-Preemptive options
- ⚡ Real-time calculation of waiting & turnaround times
- 🖥️ Clean and responsive frontend interface
- Blogs on various OS related topics.
