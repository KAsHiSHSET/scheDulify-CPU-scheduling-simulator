## 📚 About the Project

**ScheDulify** is an educational and interactive tool built to simulate different **CPU scheduling algorithms** in Operating Systems. Designed with clean visuals and user inputs, it helps understand how each scheduling algorithm behaves and how processes are prioritized and executed on the CPU.
